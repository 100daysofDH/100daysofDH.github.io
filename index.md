#The `#100DaysofDH` Challenge

Modelled after [`#100DaysofCode`](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), this is a [`100daysofX` challenge](https://www.100daysofx.com/). However, since this is not #100DaysofCode, you need not code if you don't want to. You can also use this as a writing prompt such as `#100DaysofDissertation`, as long as the generall topic qualifies as Digital Humanities.

1. __Work on your habit for minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days__
1. Tweet your progress every day with the `#100DaysOfX` hashtag and the hashtag `#100DaysofDH`: make yourself accountable so you'll be less likely to stop mid-way. 
1. Encourage/help at least 2 people in the challenge every day (via Twitter): grow your network.
1. *Extra rule*: Never miss two days in a row (or you likely won't stick with it).Â 
1. *Tip*: Set up a 'mini-habit' for breaks days, such as doing the challenge for 1 minute, web searching a term or how-to for 1 minute, writing one line of code or writing/editing one sentence.
