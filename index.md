# The #100DaysofDH Challenge

Modelled after [`#100DaysofCode`](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), this is a [`100daysofX` challenge](https://www.100daysofx.com/). However, since this is not #100DaysofCode, you need not code if you don't want to. You can also use this as a writing prompt such as `#100DaysofDissertation`, as long as the general topic qualifies as Digital Humanities (in a broad sense). 

Both newbies and seasoned DH people are welcome to join. Please promote this challenge to your students if you teach and think about providing learning materials (links will be shared here).

# The rules

1. __Work on your habit for a certain amout of time every day for the next 100 days (for example one hour)__
1. __Tweet your progress__ every day with the `#100DaysOfX` hashtag and the hashtag `#100DaysofDH`: make yourself accountable so you'll be less likely to stop mid-way. 
1. Encourage/help at least 2 people in the challenge every day (via Twitter): grow your network.
1. *Extra rule*: __Never miss two days in a row__ (or you likely won't stick with it).Â 
1. *Tip*: __Set up a 'mini-habit' for breaks days, such as doing the challenge for 1 minute,__ web searching a term or how-to for 1 minute, writing one line of code or writing/editing one sentence. Setting yourself up for success means being prepared for occasional failure!
